# 18-19-7405N
repo for 2018-2019 MHS 7405N VEX

code is located in three file: aton.cpp, init.cpp, opcontrol.cpp, in dir src

i honestly dont know why im writing this readme, but we're prob gonna have to be up l8 for this and we're gonna have to refer to
this bc we're just exhausted beyond fucking belief

so if there are any notes or whatever just who cares anymore 

for pros, there are a few main functions:
-prosv5 - gets you the info
 		make - compile
 		upload - upload to v5 brain
 		mu - short for make and upload(does both)
 		configure new-project [dir] - makes a new pros project in the specified directory

we're gonna use this mostly bc im not about to use some trash ass ide (vcs) thatll take 1304912309 years to start up, 
so im just gonna stick with vcs
